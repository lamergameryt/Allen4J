## ‚è© Quick Example

In this example for v1.0.1, we will get a users form number from his name.

```java
public final class ExampleSearch {
    public static void main(final String[] args) throws IOException, URISyntaxException {
        final String baseURL = args[0];
        final String authorization = args[1];
        final String name = args[2];

        final AllenAPI api = new AllenAPI(baseURL, authorization);

        NameSearchResponse response = api.searchByName(NameSearchRequest.build(name, 1));
        List<Student> students = response.getStudents();
        Student student = students.get(0);
        
        System.out.println("The form number of " + student.getFullName()
                + " is " + student.getFormNumber());
    }
} 
```
